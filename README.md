# BOT (Bottom water computation)

Introduction with picture: To determine the theoretical bottom water characteristics on top of the sediment cores sites, we propose a simple finder script. From an hydrological data base organized in ODV software is possible to estimate it.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Instal or use Ocean Data View software https://odv.awi.de/ or other program that allow you to obtained gridded interpolation plots (eg. surface, matlab, python, R). In this exercise we will use ODV. 
- Instal or use text file manager (eg. note ++, Excel). 
- Hydrological data set organize for be readed in ODV software 
- Create a special folder for your data 



### First Step for OVD users 

Download the latest version of ODV in https://odv.awi.de/software/download/ 

- Organize your data using the Ocean Data View (ODV) data template (excel file example). Excel file example (Please not delete the first row items, you can add new columns after the parameter “depth [m]”) https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZyONN1T7nXM2F6SS73UdqvW5-ooHM6aB/view?usp=drive_open 
- The excel file with your data needs to be exported as a text file (preference format cvs)
- Import from ODV the txt file 
- Organize the data by meridional o zonal hydrological section 
- Use the tool **clipboard copy (right bottom, option Extra) type export grilled filled values with tabulations** were used. The full grilled data was a copy in an excel file, edited the first line taking care to avoid text space and saved in txt separated with tabulations or in comma-separated csv. For futher information use https://odv.awi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/odv/misc/odv4Guide.pdf
